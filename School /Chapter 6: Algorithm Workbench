Write a program that opens an output file with the filename my_name.txt, writes your
name to the file, and then closes the file.

Version 1:
with open('my_name.txt', 'w') as f:
    f.write('ChatGPT')

Version 2:
def main():
    outfile = open("my_name.txt", "w")
    outfile.write("My Name\n")
    outfile.close()
main()

Write a program that takes an input from the user and asks to enter filename. It then
opens the file for reading it. If the file is not found, catch the exception and give a
suitable message.

def main():
    filename = input("Enter filename: ")

    try:
        with open(filename, "r") as f:
            print(f.read())
    except  FileNotFoundError:
        print("file not found")

main()

Write a program to open a file and ask the user to input the filename. If the file
exists, display the content of the file, else create a file and write the line “File is
opened in write mode”.

def main():
    filename = input("Enter filename: ")

    try:
        with open(filename, "r") as f:
            print(f.read())
    except  FileNotFoundError:
        with open(filename, "w") as f:
            f.write("File is in write mode")

main()

Write code that does the following: opens the number_list.txt file that was created
by the code you wrote in question 3, reads all of the numbers from the file and displays
them, and then closes the file.

def main():
    try:
        with open("numbers_list.txt", "r") as f:
            for line in f:
                print(line.strip())
    except FileNotFoundError:
        print("File not found")
        
main()

______________________________________________________________________________________
Modify the code that you wrote in question 4 so it adds all of the numbers read from
the file and displays their total.

def main():
    try:
        # Try to open the file in read mode
        with open('number_list.txt', 'r') as f:
            # Initialize total to 0
            total = 0
            # If successful, read each line in the file
            for line in f:
                # Try to convert the line into a number and add to total
                try:
                    total += float(line.strip())
                except ValueError:
                    # If unable to convert string to float, print an error message
                    print(f"Error: Could not convert '{line.strip()}' to a number.")
            # Print the total sum
            print("Total sum of numbers in the file:", total)
    except FileNotFoundError:
        # If the file is not found, print a suitable error message
        print('File number_list.txt not found.')

main()

Write code that opens an output file with the filename number_list.txt, but does
not erase the file’s contents if it already exists.
