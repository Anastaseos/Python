TOTAL SALES

Design a program that asks the user to enter a store’s sales for each day of the week. The
amounts should be stored in a list. Use a loop to calculate the total sales for the week and
display the result.

def main():
    days_of_the_week = ["M", "T", "W", "Th", "F", "Sa", "Su"]
    sales = []

    for day in days_of_the_week:
        while True:
            try:
                sale = float(input(f"Enter sales data for {day}: "))
                sales.append(sale)
                break
            except ValueError:
                print("invalid")


    total_sales = sum(sales)
    print(total_sales)

main()

LOTTERY NUMBER GENERATOR

Design a program that generates a seven-digit lottery number. The program should generate
seven random numbers, each in the range of 0 through 9, and assign each number to a
list element. (Random numbers were discussed in Chapter 5.) Then write another loop that
displays the contents of the list.

import random

def main():
    lottery_numbers = []
    for _ in range(7):
        number = random.randint(0, 9)
        lottery_numbers.append(number)

    print("The seven digit lottery number is:", end=" ")
    for num in lottery_numbers:
        print(num, end=" ")
    print()

main()

RAINFALL STATISTICS

Design a program that lets the user enter the total rainfall for each of 12 months into a
list. The program should calculate and display the total rainfall for the year, the average
monthly rainfall, and the months with the highest and lowest amounts.


def main():
    months = ["Jan", "Feb", "March", "April", "May", "June", "July", "Aug", "Sept", "Oct", "Nov", "Dec"]
    monthly_rainfall = []


    for month in months:
        while True:
            try:
                rainfall = float(input(f"Enter rainfall for {month} in inches: "))
                monthly_rainfall.append(rainfall)
                break
            except ValueError:
                print("Invalid")


    total_rainfall = sum(monthly_rainfall)
    average_rainfall = total_rainfall / 12


    max_rainfall = max(monthly_rainfall)
    min_rainfall = min(monthly_rainfall)
    month_max_rainfall = months[monthly_rainfall.index(max_rainfall)]
    month_min_rainfall = months[monthly_rainfall.index(min_rainfall)]

    print(total_rainfall)
    print(average_rainfall)
    print(month_max_rainfall, max_rainfall)
    print(month_min_rainfall, min_rainfall)

main()

__________________________________________________________________________________________

Design a program that asks the user to enter a series of 20 numbers. The program should
store the numbers in a list and then display the following data:
• The lowest number in the list
• The highest number in the list
• The total of the numbers in the list
• The average of the numbers in the list


def main():
    numbers = []

    for i in range(20):
        try:
            number = float(input(f"Enter number {i + 1} of 20: "))
            numbers.append(number)
        except ValueError:
            print("invalid")
            i -=1


    lowest = min(numbers)
    highest = max(numbers)
    total = sum(numbers)
    average = total / len(numbers)

    print(lowest)
    print(highest)
    print(total)
    print(average)

main()
