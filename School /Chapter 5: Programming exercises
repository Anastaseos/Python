KILOMETER CONVERTER

Write a program that asks the user to enter a distance in kilometers, and then converts that
distance to miles. The conversion formula is as follows:

def km_to_miles():
    km = float(input("Enter km: "))
    miles = km * 0.6213
    return miles


def main():
    miles = km_to_miles()
    print("The distance in miles is:", miles)

main()

HOW MUCH INSURANCE

Many financial experts advise that property owners should insure their homes or buildings
for at least 80 percent of the amount it would cost to replace the structure. Write a pro-
gram that asks the user to enter the replacement cost of a building and then displays the
minimum amount of insurance he or she should buy for the property.

def insurance():
     worth = float(input("Enter worth of the Estate: "))
     insurance = worth * 0.8
     return insurance
def main():
     min_insurance = insurance()
     print(min_insurance)
main()

AUTOMOBILE COSTS

Write a program that asks the user to enter the monthly costs for the following expenses
incurred from operating his or her automobile: loan payment, insurance, gas, oil, tires, and
maintenance. The program should then display the total monthly cost of these expenses,
and the total annual cost of these expenses.

def monthly_expenses():
    loan = float(input("Enter loan payment: "))
    insurance = float(input("Enter insurance payment: "))
    gas = float(input("Enter Gas: "))
    oil = float(input("Enter oil cost: "))
    tires = float(input("Enter tires cost: "))
    maintenance = float(input("Enter maintenance cost: "))
    total = loan + insurance + gas + oil + tires + maintenance
    return total

def main():
    total_montly_cost = monthy_expenses()
    print(total_montly_cost)
main()

PROPERTY TAX

A county collects property taxes on the assessment value of property, which is 60 percent
of the property’s actual value. For example, if an acre of land is valued at $10,000, its
assessment value is $6,000. The property tax is then 72¢ for each $100 of the assessment value. 
The tax for the acre assessed at $6,000 will be $43.20. Write a program that asks for
the actual value of a piece of property and displays the assessment value and property tax.

def value():
    property_value = float(input("Enter property value: "))
    assessment = property_value * 0.6
    property_tax = assessment * 0.72 / 100
    return assessment, property_tax

def main():
    property_tax, assessment = value()
    print("Assessment value is", property_tax)
    print("Property tax is", assessment)

main()

CALORIES FROM FATS AND CARBOHYDRATES

A nutritionist who works for a fitness club helps members by evaluating their diets. As part
of her evaluation, she asks members for the number of fat grams and carbohydrate grams
that they consumed in a day. Then, she calculates the number of calories that result from
the fat, using the following formula:

calories from fat = fat grams x 9

Next, she calculates the number of calories that result from the carbohydrates, using the
following formula:

calories from carbs = carb grams x 4

The nutritionist asks you to write a program that will make these calculations.


def calories_from_fat(fat_grams):
    return fat_grams * 9

def calories_from_carbs(carb_grams):
    return carb_grams * 4

def main():
    while True:
         choice = input("Select 1 for Fats, 2 for Carbs, or 3 to Exit: ")
         if choice == "1":
             fat_grams = float(input("Enter the amount of fat in grams: "))
             print(f"{fat_grams} grams of fat == {calories_from_fat(fat_grams):.1f} calories")
         elif choice == "2":
             carb_grams = float(input("Enter the amount of carbohydrates in grams: "))
             print(f"{carb_grams} grams of carbs == {calories_from_carbs(carb_grams):.1f} calories")
         elif choice == "3":
             print("Exiting...")
             break
         else:
             print("Invalid choice. Please choose 1, 2 or 3.")

STADIUM SEATING

There are three seating categories at a stadium. For a softball game, Class A seats cost $20,
Class B seats cost $15, and Class C seats cost $10. Write a program that asks how many
tickets for each class of seats were sold, and then displays the amount of income generated
from ticket sales.


def calculate_income(class_a_tickets, class_b_tickets, class_c_tickets):
    class_a_income = class_a_tickets * 20
    class_b_income = class_b_tickets * 15
    class_c_income = class_c_tickets * 10

    total_income = class_a_income + class_b_income + class_c_income
    return total_income


def main():
    class_a_tickets = int(input("Enter the number of Class A tickets sold: "))
    class_b_tickets = int(input("Enter the number of Class B tickets sold: "))
    class_c_tickets = int(input("Enter the number of Class C tickets sold: "))

    total_income = calculate_income(class_a_tickets, class_b_tickets, class_c_tickets)

    print(f"Total income generated from ticket sales is ${total_income}")

MONTHLY SALES TAX

A retail company must file a monthly sales tax report listing the total sales for the month,
and the amount of state and county sales tax collected. The state sales tax rate is 5 percent
and the county sales tax rate is 2.5 percent. Write a program that asks the user to enter the
total sales for the month. From this figure, the application should calculate and display the
following:
• The amount of county sales tax
• The amount of state sales tax
• The total sales tax (county plus state)


state_tax = 0.05
county_tax = 0.025

def main():
    total_sales = float(input("Enter total sales: "))
    county_sales_tax = total_sales * county_tax
    state_sales_tax = total_sales * state_tax
    total_sales_tax = county_sales_tax + state_sales_tax

    print(county_sales_tax)
    print(state_sales_tax)
    print(total_sales_tax)

FEET TO INCHES

One foot equals 12 inches. Write a function named feet_to_inches that accepts a number
of feet as an argument and returns the number of inches in that many feet. Use the function
in a program that prompts the user to enter a number of feet and then displays the number
of inches in that many feet.

def feet_to_inches(feet):
    return feet * 12

def main():
    feet = int(input("Enter number of feet: "))
    feet = feet_to_inches(feet)
    print(feet)

MATH QUIZ

Write a program that gives simple math quizzes. The program should display two random
numbers that are to be added, such as:
247
+ 129
The program should allow the student to enter the answer. If the answer is correct, a message
of congratulations should be displayed. If the answer is incorrect, a message showing
the correct answer should be displayed.


import random

OPERATORS = ["+", "-", "*", "/"]
MIN_NUMBER = 1
MAX_NUMBER = 100


def generated_questions():
    num1 = random.randint(MIN_NUMBER, MAX_NUMBER)
    num2 = random.randint(MIN_NUMBER, MAX_NUMBER)
    operator = random.choice(OPERATORS)
    question = f"What is {num1} {operator} {num2}"
    return (question, eval(str(num1) + operator + str(num2)))


def main():
    print("Welcome to my math quiz!")
    number_of_questions = int(input("How many questions?  "))
    score = 0

    for i in range(number_of_questions):
        question, answer = generated_questions()
        print(question + "?")
        user_answer = int(input())
        if user_answer == answer:
            print("Correct!")
            score += 1
        else:

    print(f"You got {score} / {number_of_questions} questions correct!")

MAX OF TWO VALUES

Write a function named max that accepts two integer values as arguments and returns the
value that is the greater of the two. For example, if 7 and 12 are passed as arguments to
the function, the function should return 12. Use the function in a program that prompts the
user to enter two integer values. The program should display the value that is the greater
of the two.


def max(x, y):
    if x > y:
        return x
    else:
        return y

def main():
    x = int(input("Enter a number: "))
    y = int(input("Enter a number: "))
    max_number = max(x, y)
    print(max_number)
