# Sentence Capitalizer: Write a program with a function that accepts a string as an argument and returns a copy of
# the string with the first character of each sentence capitalized. For instance, if the argument
# is “hello. my name is Joe. what is your name?” the function should return the string “Hello.
# My name is Joe. What is your name?” The program should let the user enter a string and
# then pass it to the function. The modified string should be displayed.


# We have a function with the string1 parameter and the str hint.
def capitalize_sentence(string1: str):
    # We are splitting the string into different sentences
    sentences = string1.split(". ")

    # Using an empty list for the capilatized sentences
    capitalized_sentences = []

    # Loop to go through the sentences and capitalize them.
    for sentence in sentences:
        capitalized_sentences.append(sentence.capitalize())

    # We are going to join the capitalized sentences
    return ". ".join(capitalized_sentences)

# User input for the sentence
user_input = input("Please enter a string: ")

# Prints the new sentence.
print(capitalize_sentence(user_input))
