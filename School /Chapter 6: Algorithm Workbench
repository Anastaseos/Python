def main():
    filename = input("Enter filename: ")

    try:
        with open(filename, "r") as f:
            print(f.read())
    except  FileNotFoundError:
        print("file not found")

main()

    try:
        with open(filename, "r") as f:
            print(f.read())
    except  FileNotFoundError:
        with open(filename, "w") as f:
