BUG COLLECTOR

A bug collector collects bugs every day for five days. Write a program that keeps a running
total of the number of bugs collected during the five days. The loop should ask for the
number of bugs collected for each day, and when the loop is finished, the program should
display the total number of bugs collected.


total_bugs = 0

for i in range(1, 6):
    bugs_collected = int(input(f"Number of bugs collected on day {i}: "))
    total_bugs += bugs_collected

print(total_bugs)

CALORIES BURNED

Running on a particular treadmill you burn 4.2 calories per minute. Write a program that
uses a loop to display the number of calories burned after 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 minutes.

calories_burned = 4.2

for minute in range(10, 31, 5):
    calories = calories_burned * minute
    print(calories)

BUDGET ANALYSIS

Write a program that asks the user to enter the amount that he or she has budgeted for
a month. A loop should then prompt the user to enter each of his or her expenses for the
month and keep a running total. When the loop finishes, the program should display the
amount that the user is over or under budget.

print("Please enter your budget for the month:")
budget = float(input())

total_expenses = 0

while True:
    print("Please enter an expense (or type '0' to finish):")
    expense = float(input())
    if expense == 0:
        break  # This will exit the loop if the user enters 0.
    else:
        total_expenses = total_expenses + expense  # Add the expense to the total.

if total_expenses > budget:
    print("You are over budget by: $" + str(total_expenses - budget))
elif total_expenses < budget:
    print("You are under budget by: $" + str(budget - total_expenses))
else:
    print("You spent exactly your budget.")
