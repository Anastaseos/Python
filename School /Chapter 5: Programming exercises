KILOMETER CONVERTER

Write a program that asks the user to enter a distance in kilometers, and then converts that
distance to miles. The conversion formula is as follows:

def km_to_miles():
    km = float(input("Enter km: "))
    miles = km * 0.6213
    return miles


def main():
    miles = km_to_miles()
    print("The distance in miles is:", miles)

main()

HOW MUCH INSURANCE

Many financial experts advise that property owners should insure their homes or buildings
for at least 80 percent of the amount it would cost to replace the structure. Write a pro-
gram that asks the user to enter the replacement cost of a building and then displays the
minimum amount of insurance he or she should buy for the property.

def insurance():
     worth = float(input("Enter worth of the Estate: "))
     insurance = worth * 0.8
     return insurance
def main():
     min_insurance = insurance()
     print(min_insurance)
main()

AUTOMOBILE COSTS

Write a program that asks the user to enter the monthly costs for the following expenses
incurred from operating his or her automobile: loan payment, insurance, gas, oil, tires, and
maintenance. The program should then display the total monthly cost of these expenses,
and the total annual cost of these expenses.

def monthly_expenses():
    loan = float(input("Enter loan payment: "))
    insurance = float(input("Enter insurance payment: "))
    gas = float(input("Enter Gas: "))
    oil = float(input("Enter oil cost: "))
    tires = float(input("Enter tires cost: "))
    maintenance = float(input("Enter maintenance cost: "))
    total = loan + insurance + gas + oil + tires + maintenance
    return total

def main():
    total_montly_cost = monthy_expenses()
    print(total_montly_cost)
main()

PROPERTY TAX

A county collects property taxes on the assessment value of property, which is 60 percent
of the property’s actual value. For example, if an acre of land is valued at $10,000, its
assessment value is $6,000. The property tax is then 72¢ for each $100 of the assessment value. 
The tax for the acre assessed at $6,000 will be $43.20. Write a program that asks for
the actual value of a piece of property and displays the assessment value and property tax.

def value():
    property_value = float(input("Enter property value: "))
    assessment = property_value * 0.6
    property_tax = assessment * 0.72 / 100
    return assessment, property_tax

def main():
    property_tax, assessment = value()
    print("Assessment value is", property_tax)
    print("Property tax is", assessment)

main()

CALORIES FROM FATS AND CARBOHYDRATES

A nutritionist who works for a fitness club helps members by evaluating their diets. As part
of her evaluation, she asks members for the number of fat grams and carbohydrate grams
that they consumed in a day. Then, she calculates the number of calories that result from
the fat, using the following formula:

calories from fat = fat grams x 9

Next, she calculates the number of calories that result from the carbohydrates, using the
following formula:

calories from carbs = carb grams x 4

The nutritionist asks you to write a program that will make these calculations.
