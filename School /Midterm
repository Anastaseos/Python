# Create a program named lastname_midterm that allows a user to make a purchase of a product.
# The user has a choice of small, medium, large or ultimate.
# They will also enter the quantity of whichever item they choose.
# The cost of each product is as follows:
# Small: $40
# Medium: $60
# Large: $80
# Ultimate: $100
# After they enter their purchase choice, the program should then ask for the user’s name.
# Once complete, output the user’s name, product, quantity purchased, and the total cost for the entire purchase.
# If the user enters an incorrect size, display an error message.



#I wanted to import time so that I can set the pace a little bit when options are printed to the console.
# With Baldurs Gate having just been released,I wanted to do a bit of a throwback to
# the Friendly Arm Inn and create a "general store" with this project.
