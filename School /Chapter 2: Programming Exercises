SALES PREDICTION

A company has determined that its annual profit is typically 23 percent of total sales. Write
a program that asks the user to enter the projected amount of total sales, and then displays
the profit that will be made from that amount.

total_sales = float(input("Please enter total sales: "))
profit = total_sales * 0.23
print("Your profit is:", profit)

LAND CALCULATION

One acre of land is equivalent to 43,560 square feet. Write a program that asks the user to
enter the total square feet in a tract of land and calculates the number of acres in the tract.

one_acre = 43560
calculate = float(input("Total Square Feet: "))
print(calculate / one_acre)

_______________________________________________________________________________________________
TOTAL PURCHASE

A customer in a store is purchasing five items. Write a program that asks for the price of
each item, and then displays the subtotal of the sale, the amount of sales tax, and the total.
Assume the sales tax is 7 percent.

SALES_TAX = 0.7
subtotal = 0

for i in range(1, 6):
    price = float(input(f"Enter the price of the item {i}: "))
    subtotal += price

sales_tax_total = subtotal * SALES_TAX
total = subtotal + sales_tax_total
print(subtotal)
print(sales_tax_total)
print(total)

DISTANCE TRAVELED

A car is traveling at 70 miles per hour. Write a program that displays the following:
• The distance the car will travel in 6 hours
• The distance the car will travel in 10 hours
• The distance the car will travel in 15 hours

speed = 70

print("Distance traveled in 6 hours:", speed * 6, "miles")
print("Distance traveled in 10 hours:", speed * 10,"miles")
print("Distance traveled in 15 hours:", speed * 15, "miles")

_______________________________________________________________________________________________
SALES TAX

Write a program that will ask the user to enter the amount of a purchase. The program
should then compute the state and county sales tax. Assume the state sales tax is 5 percent
and the county sales tax is 2.5 percent. The program should display the amount of the pur-
chase, the state sales tax, the county sales tax, the total sales tax, and the total of the sale
(which is the sum of the amount of purchase plus the total sales tax).


STATE_SALES_TAX_RATE = 0.05
COUNTY_SALES_TAX_RATE = 0.025

purchase_amount = float(input("Enter the amount of the purchase: "))

state_sales_tax = purchase_amount * STATE_SALES_TAX_RATE
county_sales_tax = purchase_amount * COUNTY_SALES_TAX_RATE

total_sales_tax = state_sales_tax + county_sales_tax
total_sale_amount = purchase_amount + total_sales_tax

print("Amount of Purchase:", purchase_amount)
print("State Sales Tax:", state_sales_tax)
print("County Sales Tax:", county_sales_tax)
print("Total Sales Tax:", total_sales_tax)
print("Total Sale Amount:", total_sale_amount)

_______________________________________________________________________________________________
MILES PER GALLON

A car’s miles-per-gallon (MPG) can be calculated with the following formula:
MPG 5 Miles driven Gallons of gas used
Write a program that asks the user for the number of miles driven and the gallons of gas
used. It should calculate the car’s MPG and display the result.

mpg = float(input("Please enter MPG: "))
gog = float(input("Please enter Gallons used: "))
print("The cars total MPG is:", mpg / gog)

_______________________________________________________________________________________________
TIP, TAX, TOTAL

Write a program that calculates the total amount of a meal purchased at a restaurant. The
program should ask the user to enter the charge for the food, and then calculate the amount
of a 18 percent tip and 7 percent sales tax. Display each of these amounts and the total.

STOCK TRANSACTION PROGRAM

Last month Joe purchased some stock in Acme Software, Inc. Here are the details of the
purchase:
• The number of shares that Joe purchased was 2,000.
• When Joe purchased the stock, he paid $40.00 per share.
• Joe paid his stockbroker a commission that amounted to 3 percent of the amount he
paid for the stock.
Two weeks later Joe sold the stock. Here are the details of the sale:
• The number of shares that Joe sold was 2,000.
• He sold the stock for $42.75 per share.
• He paid his stockbroker another commission that amounted to 3 percent of the amount
he received for the stock.
Write a program that displays the following information:
• The amount of money Joe paid for the stock.
• The amount of commission Joe paid his broker when he bought the stock.
• The amount that Joe sold the stock for.
• The amount of commission Joe paid his broker when he sold the stock.
• Display the amount of money that Joe had left when he sold the stock and paid his
broker (both times). If this amount is positive, then Joe made a profit. If the amount is
negative, then Joe lost money.

VERSION 1:
stocks = 2000
price = 40 * 2000
commission = price * 0.03
sold = 42.75 * stocks
second_commission = sold * 0.03
profit = (sold - price) - (commission + second_commission)


print("Joe paid:", price)
print("Commission was:", commission)
print("Joe sold for:", sold)
print("Second commission was:", second_commission)
print("Joe's total transaction resulted in:", profit)



VERSION 2:
PURCHASED_SHARES = 2000
PURCHASE_PRICE_PER_SHARE = 40.00
PURCHASE_COMMISSION_RATE = 0.03
SALE_PRICE_PER_SHARE = 42.75
SALE_COMMISSION_RATE = 0.03

purchase_amount = PURCHASED_SHARES * PURCHASE_PRICE_PER_SHARE
purchase_commission = purchase_amount * PURCHASE_COMMISSION_RATE

sale_amount = PURCHASED_SHARES * SALE_PRICE_PER_SHARE
sale_commission = sale_amount * SALE_COMMISSION_RATE

remaining_amount = sale_amount - sale_commission - (purchase_amount + purchase_commission)

print("Amount paid for the stock:", purchase_amount)
print("Commission paid when buying the stock:", purchase_commission)
print("Amount sold the stock for:", sale_amount)
print("Commission paid when selling the stock:", sale_commission)
print("Amount remaining after selling the stock and paying commissions:", remaining_amount)
