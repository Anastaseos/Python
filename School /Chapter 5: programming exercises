KILOMETER CONVERTER

Write a program that asks the user to enter a distance in kilometers, and then converts that
distance to miles. The conversion formula is as follows:

def km_to_miles():
    km = float(input("Enter km: "))
    miles = km * 0.6213
    return miles


def main():
    miles = km_to_miles()
    print("The distance in miles is:", miles)

main()

HOW MUCH INSURANCE

Many financial experts advise that property owners should insure their homes or buildings
for at least 80 percent of the amount it would cost to replace the structure. Write a pro-
gram that asks the user to enter the replacement cost of a building and then displays the
minimum amount of insurance he or she should buy for the property.
